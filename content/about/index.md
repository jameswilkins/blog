## Me

I've worked within the technology industry for approximately 20 years now (wow - feeling old!).  I'm currently working at Red Hat as a Senior Architect within the consulting team, assisting customers delivering complex IT solutions.  I predominantly work in the storage and container ecosystems but have an interest in most things Linux related.

Prior to this I worked in the hosting industry delivering complex solutions on a global scale.

The purpose of this site is for me to write about things I've found interesting, either via working on them for clients or general interest.

Opinions expressed are my own and not related to/endorsed by my employer in any fashion.

## This Website

This website is a static website.  It's stored in its entirety within [GitHub](https://github.com/jameswilkins/blog). I utilise [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate a static site from the files stored within git.

Those generated site is then hosted by [NetLify](https://netlify.com) on a global CDN network.

Updates are made by editing on my local workstation and committing into git.

### Infrastructure

#### Cloudflare

I utilise [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to both host the DNS and initial ingress point for the website.

SSL is terminated at Cloudflare and then re-encrypted back onto NetLify.

I opted for this approach versus hosting everything with NetLify for a few reasons;

* I like to keep my DNS all in one place as I have other domain names
* I admire CloudFlare's approach to enabling new technologies (for example, HTTP/3) rapidly
* Cloudflare performs a series of optimisations on the website to ensure it load's quickly

#### NetLify

NetLify performs the site construction and publishes the website to their world-wide CDN network.

The site on NetLify has a custom SSL certificate (Cloudflare Origin certificate) which is used to encrypt traffic between Cloudflare <=> NetLify

#### GitHub

The main site is hosted in GitHub [here](https://github.com/jameswilkins/blog).  

I also make use of [GitHub LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-large-files/working-with-large-files) for specific directories that contain images/other-specific content.  This is to prevent the main repo filling up with (non-necessary) versioning information for these data-types.

#### Workflow

Posting updates to the web-site works like so

* Checkout GitHub repository 
* Update content / create new post
* Commit into GitHub
* NetLify triggers a build once git is updated - it checks out the content from git, applies the Hugo generator to the site and then publishes it on a specific URL.  A sample deployment is below
